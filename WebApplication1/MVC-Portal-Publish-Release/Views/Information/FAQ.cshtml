                            If you are in an organized travel group, you will have someone to accompany you during emergencies. If you are travelling independently, you can still have an emergency contact number for the destination,
                            and an emergency number for our control center in India / United Kingdom. Once alerted, our team will do everything possible to help the traveler in case on an emergency.
                            For all trips, we will help you buy the correct insurance, and will provide you with all the emergency contact numbers.
